# Overview

## Background

In order to provide higher capital efficiency, pools can hold wrapped tokens of other DeFi instruments that generate revenue, improving the overall pool yield. The problem with this solution is that wrapping and unwrapping tokens not only needs to be done with a relayer but also costs too much has to be done during a swap: and even then, this would need to be done through a relayer. Curve pools with wrapped tokens use 400k to 800k gas on each swap.

Linear pools is a solution to avoid wrapping/unwrapping tokens during a swap, and leave those expensive tasks to arbitragers - who are correctly incentivized to do it. More precisely, a linear pool always has an underlying token (eg. DAI),  which we'll call the **"main token"**, and one or more wrapped versions of it (eg. cDAI, aDAI).

Intuitively, linear pools work like this: instead of having each trader wrap and unwrap tokens during the swap, the pool - which contains both tokens - just returns the target tokens from the existing balance, charging a small fee. These fees are then paid to arbitrageurs, who 'rebalance' the pool by wrapping/unwrapping.

For example, ten traders might be charged a $0.5 fee, for a total fee balance of $5. An arbitrageur could then rebalance the pool at a profit, as long as the gas cost was less than $5.

## Exchange Rate

It is the rate used to convert a wrapped token unit in the linear pool to a main token unit (e.g. cDAI is converted into DAI). It is essential to have an exact and non-manipulable exchange rate between each wrapped token and the main one.

Exchange rate will be cached per token to reduce gas costs.

## Invariant

A linear pool has the following invariant equation:

$\sum_{i=0}^{i=n-1}{b_i * er_i} = I$

where **b** is the balance and **er** the exchange rate. For main token,  $er = 1$ .

## Swaps

The Swap In-Given-Out equation is very cheap:

$a_{out}=a_{in}$

With fees:

$a_{out}=a_{in} \cdot (1-fee)$

Because the Balancer V2 Vault is optimized to swap across multiple pools, and linear pool swaps are very cheap, the result is that the overall swap remains cheap: many times cheaper than Curve.

## BPT as Swap

![Overview%20e466382b07454cacaede83ad8f457393/Untitled%203.png](Overview%20e466382b07454cacaede83ad8f457393/Untitled%203.png)

One way to use a linear pool is for the "source" pool to directly hold the wrapped token. For example, a DAI/cDAI linear pool can have an associated "source" WETH/cDAI weighted pool. 

However, this has two problems:

- LPs will join the WETH/cDAI weighted pool with DAI, and if there is not enough liquidity on the linear pool, it will fail. Let's say the DAI/cDAI linear pool has balances of 1000/1000, and you want to join with 2000 DAI. It will fail.
- There is no real incentive to provide liquidity to the linear pool, as swap fees are low and used to pay arbitrageurs.

  

So, instead of using the wrapped token in the WETH/cDAI source pool, it is better to use the BPT of the DAI/cDAI linear pool directly, let's call it bcDAI. We will then have a WETH/bcDAI weighted pool. This has the advantage that it provides max liquidity when joining the weighted pool with DAI, because the linear pool can just mint whatever amount of BPT is required. It also incentivizes adding liquidity to the linear pool, since this happens indirectly: from the user's perspective, they are simply joining a weighted pool (and can expect the usual yield from swap fees).

The problem now is that a swap between the source WETH/bcDAI pool and the DAI/cDAI linear pool consists of a join + swap or swap + exit. This requires a batch relayer.

Yet with a little sleight of hand there is a way to avoid even this. The linear pool can pre-mint the entire supply of BPT, and hold these tokens in the Vault, so that it is effectively a three-token pool. With that in place, it can swap a BPT for the main token and it works like a single join but within the swap hook.

![Overview%20e466382b07454cacaede83ad8f457393/Untitled%204.png](Overview%20e466382b07454cacaede83ad8f457393/Untitled%204.png)

More precisely, in the constructor, the linear pool will register to the Vault with its tokens + its BPT (itself), premint BPT and do the initial join with those BPT. The amount of BPT the pool can premint is limited to the max balance that the Vault can hold, 2^112 - 1. But because the BPT is the sum of the other tokens, the max amount to premint is (2^112 - 1) / N where N is the number of tokens. 

When preminting such huge amount of BPT and adding it to the vault, it will break TVL because of duplicate value. However to be consistent with ERC20 protocol, BPT functions balanceOf and totalSupply will not be changed. 

Projects that calculate TVL, will need to take into consideration not to add to TVL a token when  is hold by a pool which address equals the token.

## Fee structure

Consider a pool formed by two tokens, a main token and a derived token, like DAI and cDAI.

We want to ensure certain availability of the main token, so we set a lower target amount $T_1$. But we also want to incentivize that most of the value of the pool be in the derived token to achieve larger profit. So we set an upper target amount $T_2 \ge T_1$. 

Any operation that leaves the pool with less than $T_1$ of the main token, will entail a positive fee (only applied to the segment under $T_1$), while any operation that returns the balance towards $T_1$ (from below) will entail a negative fee. Similarly, any operation that leaves the pool with more than $T_2$ entails a positive fee, and returning to $T_2$ from above entails a negative fee. These fees are always received and paid in the main token. We will equate positive and negative fees.

In the following we explain how we can efficiently compute the fee of any operation (swap, join or exit). After deducting the fee, we simply have to apply the current rate of conversion (conversion between tokens and BPTs are also determined by the current rate). Thus, the delicate part is the fee.

It is useful to theoretically divide the reserves of the main token into two variables: collected fees F and the nominal balance B (the contract will only store the full balance $B+F$). It is a simple but nontrivial observation that F can be written as a function of B:

$$F(B)=\phi(T_1-B)I_{B \le T_1} + \phi(B-T_2)I_{B \ge T_2}$$

Here $\phi < 1$ denotes the fee fraction and $I$  denotes indicator function.

Now we can write the full balance of the main token as a continuous strictly increasing piecewise linear function of the nominal balance $B$.

$$B+F(B) = \begin{cases} ( (1-\phi)B + \phi T_1) \ I_{B \le T_1} \ + \\ B \ I_{T_1 \le B \le T_2\le B} \ + \\ ((1+\phi)B - \phi T_2) \ I_{T_2 \le B}\end{cases}$$

This function can be inverted easily, and this allows to compute the fee for an operation where the variation of the full balance is specified. For example a swap where the exact main token amount in or out is given: we first compute the final value of $B+F$, then using the inverse we can compute the final value of $B$, so we obtain the fee amount of the operation. In other cases, the variation of $B$ is given or computed first, so we have to use the direct function formula above.

The function $B+F$ is simply a bijection between real and nominal balance of the pool. If we modify this function by a constant, the outcome of the operations will remain the same. The only constraint for this is that the real balance must always be at least zero. Thus we will substract the constant $\phi T_1$, so that the line starts at $(0,0)$. In the following, $R$ denotes the real balance.

$$R(B) = \begin{cases}  (1-\phi)B \ I_{B \le T_1} \ + \\ (B-\phi T_1) \ I_{T_1 \le B \le T_2} \ + \\ ((1+\phi)B - \phi (T_1 + T_2)) \ I_{T_2 \le B}\end{cases}$$

This function can be visualized [here](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/fegbavml0q?lang=es).

 Some testing of this can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mqwh3-5XM4e6bwIoIuDwwswnJwGxQhHNJWQV34WNFBQ/edit#gid=1825693303).

### Initializing pool

The pool can be initialized at zero balance.

### Increasing / Decreasing targets

When targets are changed, there will be an excess or lack of fees. 

For example, if   $T_1$ is increased or  $T_2$ is decreased and there is a lack of fees, it will be responsibility for the executor of that change to add the them. The *setMainTokenTargets* function will collect the needed fees directly from the caller. 

If   $T_1$ is decreased or  $T_2$ is increased, there will be spare fees. In that case, nothing needs to be done so they will be given to the LPs.

### Change fee %

If fee is decremented, nothing needs to be done.

If incremented and there is fee accumulated (balance is out of target range), then callers needs to pay for lacking fees. 

### Maintenance

Fees and Targets will need to be managed by a third party and changed accordingly to match incentives, gas costs and pool liquidity.

## Protocol Fees

To keep linear pools cheap in terms of gas - and because swap fees are small - they will not have a protocol fee. 

## Interactions

If we have a linear pool with DAI/CDAI, there are the main interactions the pool will have:

### LPS

**Join with exact DAI** 

When an LP JOINS an upper pool with EXACT DAI or swaps EXACT DAI for TOKEN (swap given in). 

**Join for exact BPT**

When an LP JOINS an upper pool for EXACT BPT or swaps DAI for EXACT TOKENI (swap given out).  

**Exit with exact BPT**

When an LP EXITS an upper pool with EXACT BPT or swaps EXACT TOKEN for DAI (swap given in)

**Exit for exact DAI**

When an LP EXITS an upper pool for EXACT DAI or swaps TOKEN for EXACT DAI (swap given out)

### ARBITRAGEURS **AND DAPPS**

**Swap given in DAI**

Arbitrageurs will swap DAI for CDAI to refill DAI balance and get the fee. 

Dapps that use linear pools to enter Compound.

**Swap given out DAI**

Arbitrageurs will swap CDAI for DAI to refill CDAI balance and get the fee. 

**Swap given in CDAI**

Dapps that use linear pools to exit Compound will  have CDAI to swap for DAI. 

**Swap given out CDAI**

Not used in general, but it will be implemented as it comes for fee in the code.

## Huge amount interactions

Lets continue with the same linear pool example DAI/CDAI

**Huge Exits**

They will fail if not enough DAI. To avoid it, a relayer can be created to **swap given in DAI** for CDAI, unbalancing the pool, and then **exit with BPT** for DAI to rebalance and get the fees back.  

**Huge Joins**

They will incur in an important fee for the LP. To avoid it, a relayer can be created to **join with DAI**, unbalancing the pool, and then **swap given out DAI** to rebalance and get the fees back.  

**No relayer (advanced)**

For huge exits, can also be implemented in **exit with BPT** that if there is not enough DAI, to get CDAI, unwrap it in Compound and return BPT. It can even balance the pool back getting a small return. Same way we could wrap DAI for huge joins, to avoid paying fees.

To implement this, the linear pools needs to have a general specialization while still having the minimal-swap-info specialization.  

## Wrapping everything

### Compound COMP airdrops

Compound airdrops COMP tokens to cToken holders. So, for example, when a linear pool holds cDAI, Compound will airdrop COMP tokens to the Vault (where cDAI are really held) and they will not be extractable. To solve this, the cDAI tokens that are added to the linear pool need to be previously wrapped (wcDAI) into a contract that knows how to deal with COMP.

### Aave rateless tokens

AAVE tokens (aDAI, aUSDC, etc) are pegged 1:1 to the main token instead of having a rate. To solve this, AAVE tokens need to be wrapped (waDAI, waUSDC, etc) into a contract that calculates and returns the current rate. 

**IMPORTANT**

**Creating all these new layers of wrapping (eg: wcDAI, waDAI) does not add costs to the trader or LP, because they always swap between DAI and the linear pool BPT.** 

**All wrapping and unwrapping tasks are performed by the arbitragers - this simply makes the arbitrageur 'rebalancing' use a bit more gas, which will be covered by trading fees.**

## Decrementing rate

What happens if for some reason a wrapped token rate decreases? LPs will take the losses. This is acceptable, because LPs have to trust the instrument that wrapped the token. However, fees collected can be reduced in value, and the incentive to rebalance lost. A potential solution is to collect fees only in the main token. 

[IN PROGRESS]

## Advantages of linear pools

- Scales well, less DAI required means greater capital efficiency.
- Adding many levels of wrapping does not affect swaps.
- Incentives are aligned.
- Does not deviate from AMM standard practices (e.g., arbitrage through swapping).
- Third party interest: DEX aggregators, Dharma, PoolTogether. Cheaper than wrapping, and sometimes even profitable.
- Marketing: new type of pool.

## Other ideas

Linear pools work for any group of tokens where there is an exact "not manipulable" rate between them. Eg. DAI and CDAI. So it can be a way to "enter or exit" any protocol as long as the rate is not manipulable. If a protocol is very expensive to join or exit, using Balancer can be the solution. You can switch or rebalance your investments among many protocols very cheap in a single swap (move your investments in DAI from Yearn to Compound and Aave). This is something that if you do it directly in those instruments, either manually or with a smart contract, is way more complicated and expensive in terms of gas.
